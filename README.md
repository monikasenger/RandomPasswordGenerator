# RandomPasswordGenerator

# I developed a program that generates secure, random passwords based on user preferences. The program prompts the user to:
#  1.Enter the desired password length.
#  2.Specify if the password should include numbers, lowercase letters, uppercase letters, and special characters.
#  The program then generates the password accordingly and displays it to the user.
